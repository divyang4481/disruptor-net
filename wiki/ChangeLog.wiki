===5th July 2011===
 * Added Microsoft TPL Dataflow comparison to Uni and Pipe perf tests
 * Ported all remaining performance tests. All Java code has now been ported.

===4th July 2011===
 * ported latency test
 * ported latest disruptor (Java) changes
 *fixed bugs
 *performance (throughput) is now equivalent to the Java version

===3rd July 2011===
 * removed IEntry and replaced it with struct Entry: data processed by the disruptor no longer need to implement a specific interface
 * split the implementation in 2: RingBuffer for reference type and ValueTypeRingBuffer for value types.

===28th June 2011===
 * automated build process
 * imported several .net performance test tools ([http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=16273 ClrProfiler], [http://bcl.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=PerfMonitor&referringTitle=Home Perf Monitor]) and found one source of allocation. This is now fixed, the disruptor does not create any garbage once started.
 * first perf test ported (1 producer, 1 consumer): first results show about 9-10 million msg/sec on my dual core i7 @ 2.67GHz
 * perf test does not stop properly all the time, to investigate...

===27th June 2011===
 * code base: all classes have been ported except Histogram.java
 * unit tests: all unit tests have been ported but 2 are failing and need to be fixed.
 * perf tests: TODO
